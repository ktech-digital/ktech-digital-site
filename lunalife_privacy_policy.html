<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 16, 2025</p>
<p><strong>LunaLife</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the LunaLife mobile application (“App”) handles your data.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>We <strong>do not collect</strong>, store, or share any personal information or user data through the LunaLife app. Specifically, we do not receive:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Names, email addresses, or phone numbers</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
    <li>Access to contacts or calendars</li>
    <li>Device identifiers or app usage analytics</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Subscriptions and RevenueCat</h2>
<p>We use the <strong>RevenueCat</strong> service to process subscriptions. RevenueCat communicates with the Apple App Store and Google Play Store to validate purchases and manage subscription status. RevenueCat may receive and process the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>User identifiers provided by the App Store or Google Play Store</li>
    <li>Subscription status information (active/inactive, expiration date, etc.)</li>
    <li>Metadata related to purchases</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use this data for targeted advertising or analytics outside of the functions necessary for subscription management.</p>
<p>For more details on how RevenueCat processes data, please refer to their <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>3. Offline Functionality</h2>
<p>The app can work <strong>fully offline</strong> using only data stored on your device. However, an internet connection is required for subscription purchases, opening external links (such as this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use), and — in the future — to fetch updated moon day data from our servers.</p>

<h2>4. Crash Reporting (App Store and Google Play)</h2>
<p>We may receive <strong>anonymous crash reports</strong> automatically provided by the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. These reports are used solely to improve stability and performance and may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device model</li>
    <li>Operating system version</li>
    <li>Technical logs (stack traces)</li>
</ul>
<p>No personally identifiable information is included.</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The LunaLife app does not use any third-party advertising or analytics SDKs, except for RevenueCat, which is used solely for subscription management.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>Since we do not collect personal data, all information about your app usage remains on your device, except for the technical data required for subscription management and provided via the App Store/Google Play through RevenueCat.</p>

<h2>7. Your Consent</h2>
<p>By using LunaLife, you confirm that you have read and agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us:</p>

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 16 August 2025</p>
<p><strong>LunaLife</strong> (“we”, “our” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the LunaLife mobile application (“App”) processes your data.</p>

<h2>1. Information we do not collect</h2>
<p>We <strong>do not collect</strong>, store, or transmit contact details (name, email, phone), location data, contacts/calendar content, or the <strong>Advertising ID (AD_ID)</strong>. The App contains no third-party advertising and does not use advertising trackers or analytics SDKs.</p>
<ul>
    <li>names, email addresses, or phone numbers;</li>
    <li>location data;</li>
    <li>access to contacts or calendar;</li>
    <li>advertising identifiers (AD_ID) or behavioural analytics.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Exception:</em> strictly necessary technical data from the stores (Apple/Google) and RevenueCat are processed for subscriptions — see Section&nbsp;2.</p>

<h2>2. Subscriptions and RevenueCat</h2>
<p>We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to handle subscriptions. RevenueCat interacts with the Apple App Store and Google Play Store to verify purchases and manage subscription status. In this process, the following may be processed:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>purchase tokens/transaction identifiers</strong> provided by the App Store/Google Play;</li>
    <li><strong>subscription status</strong> (active/cancelled, start/end dates, period, pricing/currency/country information);</li>
    <li><strong>SDK technical information</strong> required to verify purchases and restore access (e.g., OS version/device model);</li>
    <li>real-time subscription event notifications from Google Play (RTDN), containing subscription state only.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use this data for targeted advertising or profiling beyond what is necessary to operate subscriptions.</p>
<p>For details on RevenueCat’s processing, see their <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>3. Offline operation</h2>
<p>The App can operate <strong>fully offline</strong> using data stored on your device. Internet connectivity is required to purchase/restore a subscription, open external links (e.g., this Policy or Terms), and — in the future — to fetch updated lunar data from our servers.</p>

<h2>4. Crash reports (App Store and Google Play)</h2>
<p>We may receive <strong>anonymous crash reports</strong> automatically provided by the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. These reports are used solely to improve stability and performance and may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>device model;</li>
    <li>operating system version;</li>
    <li>technical logs (stack traces).</li>
</ul>
<p>No personal information is included in these reports.</p>

<h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
<p>The LunaLife App does not use third-party advertising or analytics SDKs, except for RevenueCat which is used exclusively to manage subscriptions. The Advertising ID (AD_ID) is not requested or used.</p>

<h2>6. Data security</h2>
<p>We follow data minimisation principles and use providers that protect data in transit and at rest (e.g., encrypted transport). All information about your App usage remains on your device, except for technical subscription data provided via the App Store/Google Play with RevenueCat.</p>

<h2>7. Legal bases for processing</h2>
<p>We process data under the following UK GDPR legal bases:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>contract performance</strong> — providing access to paid content under a subscription;</li>
    <li><strong>legitimate interests</strong> — maintaining a stable and secure App (including anonymous crash reports);</li>
    <li><strong>legal obligations</strong> — accounting/tax obligations related to transactions, where applicable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Retention</h2>
<p>Subscription-related data (via the stores and RevenueCat) is retained <strong>only as long as necessary</strong> to provide the service, resolve payments/refunds, and meet legal obligations, after which it is deleted or anonymised.</p>

<h2>9. International transfers</h2>
<p>Our service providers (e.g., RevenueCat) may process data outside the United Kingdom/EEA using appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses). We use only vetted processors.</p>

<h2>10. Your rights</h2>
<p>You have rights under the UK GDPR, including access, rectification, deletion, restriction, portability, and objection. To exercise your rights, contact us using the details below. For security, we may ask you to confirm ownership of the store account (Apple/Google) used for the subscription.</p>

<h2>11. Children</h2>
<p>The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the equivalent age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with such data, contact us and we will remove it.</p>

<h2>12. User consent</h2>
<p>By using LunaLife, you confirm that you have read and agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>13. Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Policy from time to time. The current version will be published in the App and on our website with the effective date. By continuing to use the App after publication, you agree to the updated version.</p>

<h2>14. Governing law</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the United Kingdom. The courts of Scotland shall have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>15. Attribution and content licensing</h2>
<p>All digital content in the LunaLife App — including, without limitation, images, icons, day symbols, moon phases, and banners — is created by KTECH DIGITAL LTD with the help of AI-based tools. Certain video materials (e.g., a moon rotation clip) are licensed from <a href="https://pixabay.com/videos/moon-rotation-loop-craters-heaven-44335/" target="_blank">Pixabay</a> and used in accordance with its terms. Copying, reproducing, or distributing these materials without our prior written consent is prohibited.</p>

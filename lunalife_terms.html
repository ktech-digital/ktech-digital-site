<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last updated: 21 August 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to LunaLife — an application developed and owned by KTECH DIGITAL LTD (“we”, “us”, “our”).
    These Terms of Service govern your use of the LunaLife mobile application (the “App”) and any related services.</p>

<h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By downloading, installing, or using LunaLife, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.
    If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

<h2>3. Use of the App</h2>
<p>You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.
    You must not engage in any activity that could damage, overload, or impair the App, or interfere with any other user’s use of the App.</p>

<h2>4. Purchases & Payments</h2>
<p><strong>4.1. General.</strong> Paid features are provided via subscription. All purchases are processed <strong>exclusively</strong> through the relevant app store — Apple App Store or Google Play — under the store’s own terms and policies. We do not accept direct payments and we do not store payment card details.</p>
<p><strong>4.2. Auto-renewal.</strong> Subscriptions are <em>auto-renewing</em>: at the end of the paid term, your subscription renews automatically unless you cancel. You may cancel at any time; access remains available until the end of the current paid term.</p>
<p><strong>4.3. Managing your subscription.</strong> You can cancel or change your subscription in the store through which you purchased (App Store / Google Play). For convenience, links may be provided inside the App.</p>
<p><strong>4.4. Trials & promotions.</strong> If a free or discounted trial is offered, the subscription converts to a paid plan at the end of the trial unless you cancel before the trial ends. Promotional terms and availability may vary by country and time.</p>
<p><strong>4.5. Pricing & taxes.</strong> Subscription price, currency, and applicable taxes are shown in the store interface and may vary by region. We may change prices; the store will notify you, and changes apply from the next billing period. If you do not agree with the new price, cancel before renewal.</p>
<p><strong>4.6. Refunds.</strong> Refunds are governed solely by the applicable store’s policies (Apple/Google). We do not issue refunds directly and cannot reverse store transactions.</p>
<p><strong>4.7. Payment issues.</strong> If a payment fails (e.g., insufficient funds, expired card), the store may provide a grace/hold period. If the issue is not resolved, access to paid content may be suspended until renewal succeeds.</p>

<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All content in the App, including text, graphics, images, and data, is owned by KTECH DIGITAL LTD or used under license and is protected by copyright, trademarks, and other intellectual property laws.
    Copying, reproducing, or distributing any part of the App without prior written consent is prohibited.</p>
<p>All digital content in the App — including, without limitation, lunar day symbols, moon-phase imagery, banners, and other graphics — was created by KTECH DIGITAL LTD with the help of AI-based tools. Any third-party stock materials, such as a moon rotation video (<a href="https://pixabay.com/videos/moon-rotation-loop-craters-heaven-44335/" target="_blank">source</a>), are used under Pixabay or other applicable licenses that allow commercial use without attribution. Such content is either owned by KTECH DIGITAL LTD or lawfully licensed and may not be copied, reproduced, or distributed without prior written consent.</p>

<h2>6. Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The content provided in LunaLife is for informational and personal development purposes only.
    It does not constitute medical, psychological, or professional advice. You use the App at your own risk.</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, KTECH DIGITAL LTD shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the App, whether or not we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to the Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be published in the App or on our website. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

<h2>9. Suspension/Termination</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time without prior notice or liability if you violate these Terms, applicable laws, or engage in activity that may harm the App, its users, or our business.</p>

<h2>10. Sanctions & Restricted Use</h2>
<p>You agree not to use the App if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>you are located in a country/territory subject to comprehensive trade sanctions or embargoes under the laws of the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States, or the United Nations;</li>
    <li>you are a person or entity listed on any applicable sanctions list, including (without limitation) the UK Sanctions List, the EU Consolidated List, the U.S. Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, or the UN Sanctions List;</li>
    <li>your transaction or activity would violate applicable export control, anti-money laundering (AML), or counter-terrorist financing laws.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Payments for digital content and subscriptions are made exclusively via Apple App Store or Google Play under their rules.</strong> You are responsible for complying with applicable sanctions and legal restrictions. We may suspend access where we reasonably suspect sanctions violations.</p>

<h2>11. Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United Kingdom. The courts of Scotland shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms.</p>
